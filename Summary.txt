PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

I am a self-employed Android developer. My apps are available on both, Google Play Store and Amazon Appstore.
Currently, I have over thirty apps available to the public. I have five apps that are in the 100K+ install range, in Google
Play alone, and a bunch of apps under 100K installs. At the moment, I am working on my own projects, and improving
my skills. However, I am open to working with others. Also, I am open to moving.

I dedicate my time to learning new skills, and also learning to solve the same problems, but in exponential ways. Since I have over thirty apps, I get to play around with different types of scenarios. As a result, I end up becoming comfortable
with solving many problems. Once I learn a certain skill, I update several of my apps to practice my understanding. After
that, I develop new apps in order to challenge myself to create something new. This process helps me gain a deeper
understanding of my own skill level, and it challenges me to continually improve my skills. The bottom line is that I have
to keep learning in order to create greater things than I already have.
